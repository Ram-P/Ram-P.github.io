Teaching
------
- **Graduate Student Instructor**, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor \
_EECS 460 — Control System Analysis and Design_, January — April 2023 \
Taught two discussion sessions each week, held office hours and graded exams.

- **Graduate Student Instructor**, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor \
_EECS 301 — Probabilistic Methods in Engineering_, August — December 2022 \

Mentoring
------
- [Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship Program (URAP)](https://grad.illinois.edu/urap), University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, August 2024 — May 2025

- [Promoting Undergraduate Research in Engineering (PURE)](https://pure.engr.illinois.edu/), University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, August — December 2023 \
Mentored a group of three undergraduates at UIUC in investigating the performance of different nonlinear Kalman filters on the problem of battery state-of-charge estimation. (One student subsequently joined our primary research group.)

Other Experience
------
- **Research Intern**, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, Mumbai, India \
_Systems and Control Engineering_, December 2020 — May 2021 \
Used feedback linearization to achieve an upwind climb in gliding unmanned aerial vehicles, avoiding heavy computations from optimal control formulations. Simulations performed with various wind-gradient models.

- **Research Intern**, U. R. Rao Satellite Centre (Indian Space Research Organization), Bengaluru, India \
_Control and Digital Electronics Group_, June — July 2019 \
Studied the properties of the Linear and Ensemble Kalman Filter. These were applied to a one– and three-dimensional motion estimation problem.
